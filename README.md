# AndroidQuizApp
This is a quiz app with basic Android questions

It is part of Udacity's Android Basics course and ALC's #&DaysOfCodeChallenge. We were to create a quiz app consisting of 4-10 questions.
The app would have multiple views, checkboxes, radio buttons, free text answers, use of nested ViewGroups, good coding practices to be used and ScrollView.
The user would click a submit button that would in turn return a score through a toast message.

Below is a link of the apk file
